            With over 25 years of hands-on experience in the home improvement industry, I've had the privilege of working my way up from a window installer and delivery driver to owning my own business. My journey began with humble beginnings, where I honed my skills through hard work and dedication across various roles. I've had the pleasure of working with reputable companies like Wallside Windows, Majic Windows, and Hill Top Tree Service, each providing an invaluable wealth of experience and knowledge.

            Through these years, I've built a solid foundation in everything from window installation to broader home improvement services, always prioritizing quality craftsmanship and customer satisfaction. This experience has led me to where I am todayâ€”founding Better Windows Inc, my own company dedicated to providing top-notch windows, doorwalls, and comprehensive home improvement solutions.
